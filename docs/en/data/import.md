## 📖 Key Migration Guides

### 🗺️ Google Authenticator (GA) Migration
Since GA does not support direct file export, follow these steps:
1.  In the GA app on your phone, tap "Transfer accounts" -> "**Export accounts**".
2.  In the NodeAuth import interface, scan the generated QR codes.
3.  **Multi-page Handling**: If you have many accounts, GA will show multiple pages (1/3, 2/3...). NodeAuth supports **continuous scan caching**; simply scan all pages and merge with one click.

### 🗺️ Microsoft Authenticator Migration
For Android users with root access, you can export and upload the database files from:
*   `/data/data/com.azure.authenticator/databases/PhoneFactor`
*   It is recommended to also upload the accompanying `-wal` and `-shm` files.

### 🗺️ Steam Guard Migration
If you use **Steam Desktop Authenticator (SDA)**:
1.  Locate your `.maFile` files (found in SDA's `maFiles` directory).
2.  Drag these files directly into the NodeAuth import area. The system will automatically extract the Steam shared secrets and generate codes.

## ⚠️ Important Migration Notes
*   **Automated Deduplication**: The system identifies duplicates based on secrets and account names. Existing accounts will be skipped to keep your vault clean.
*   **Zero-Knowledge Decryption**: For encrypted backups (like 2FAS or Aegis), all decryption happens **locally in your browser**. Your password never leaves your device.
*   **Emergency Recovery Pack**: If you export a PDF or backup containing encryption keys, keep it safe. This file is essential for disaster recovery.
*   **Import Report**: After the operation, the system displays a real-time report of "Success", "Skipped", and "Failed" items for easy troubleshooting.
*   **Further Help**: For complex format issues, refer to the [Disaster Recovery Guide](../recovery/index.md).
