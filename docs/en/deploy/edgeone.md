## 📝 Notes
*   **Database Compatibility**: The method for binding the D1 database in the EdgeOne environment is slightly different from Cloudflare. Please refer to Tencent Cloud's official D1 adaptation documentation.
*   **Request Limits**: Ensure that your EdgeOne plan has sufficient quota to support the application's concurrent requests.
