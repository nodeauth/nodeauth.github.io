## ☁️ Cloudflare Worker Update
1. **Automatic Update**: If you have configured GitHub Action, simply execute `Sync Fork` in your forked repository. GitHub will automatically trigger the deployment.
2. **Manual Update**:
    *   Execute `git pull` locally to synchronize the latest code.
    *   Run `npm run deploy` to republish.

## 🐳 Docker Update
If you use Docker for deployment, updating is very simple:

```bash
# 1. Enter your deployment directory
cd /path/to/nodeauth

# 2. Pull the latest image
docker compose pull

# 3. Restart the service
docker compose up -d

# 4. Clean up old images (Optional)
docker image prune -f
```

## 🛠️ Maintenance Suggestions
1. **Regular Backups**: Although the system supports automatic backups, it is recommended to manually export a `JSON` file to an offline drive monthly.
2. **Monitor Logs**:
    *   Docker: `docker logs -f nodeauth`
    *   Worker: View `Real-time Logs` in the Cloudflare dashboard.
3. **Check Token Expiration**: If you use WebDAV or S3, periodically check if the cloud storage Access Key/Secret Key are still valid.

> [!WARNING]
> **Pre-update Advice**: Before performing any major version updates, please ensure you perform a "Data Export" to ensure your assets are absolutely safe.
