# Ultimate Experience: Smooth Interaction & PWA

A good security tool shouldn't be cold; it should be warm and seamless. NodeAuth provides a native-level smooth experience through "offline-first" and "full-ecosystem migration" technologies.

## 📱 1. Offline-First Architecture & Instant Startup
NodeAuth is not just a "web-based" tool; it utilizes advanced PWA technology to ensure stability in extreme environments:
*   **Instant Startup**: Core application logic is preloaded into the local Service Worker. Even without a network, the application responds immediately when opened.
*   **Local Calculation**: TOTP algorithms (including Steam-specific algorithms) are executed entirely on the frontend. This means you can still get your verification codes normally even in areas without signals, such as on planes or in basements.
*   **Resource Pre-Warming**: Silently pre-warms heavy asynchronous components that may be needed later during system idle time, maintaining zero latency for the interface.

## 📦 2. Seamless Ecosystem Migration (Smooth Migration)
Migrating to NodeAuth from other 2FA tools is extremely simple and painless. Our intelligent detection engine supports over 20 mainstream apps:
*   **Standalone Apps**: Support for exports from 2FAS (.2fas), Aegis (.json), Raivo, Ente Auth, Authenticator Pro, etc.
*   **Password Managers**: Support for Bitwarden (encrypted parsing), 1Password (CSV), KeePassXC, etc.
*   **Major Platform Protocols**: Support for Google Authenticator (multi-page QR scanning) and Microsoft Authenticator.
*   **Local Processing**: All migration logic is executed locally in your browser. None of your secrets are ever uploaded to the server.

## 💎 3. Native-Level PWA Experience (Native Feel)
*   **Cross-Platform Installation**: Support for installing NodeAuth on iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, or Linux.
*   **Standalone Operation**: Break free from the browser's address bar and tabs to gain an immersive native App visual experience.
*   **Mobile Hub**: Automatically switches to a bottom navigation mode on mobile devices, providing a dedicated hub station for convenient one-handed operation of all core functions.

## ✨ 4. Ultimate Visual & Interaction Details (UI/UX)
*   **Digit Chunking**: Verification codes use `3+3` or `2+3` style whitespace segmentation, greatly improving eye recognition and manual entry efficiency.
*   **Next Code Pre-Reading**: Click the countdown ring to reveal the next period's verification code in advance, resolving "last 3 seconds" entry anxiety.
*   **Dynamic Animations**: Hierarchical depth-of-field navigation simulates the layered physical effects of native systems, making every click feel responsive.
