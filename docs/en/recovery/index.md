# Emergency Recovery & Disaster Survival

In extreme disaster scenarios (such as complete server failure, accidental database leaks, or deployment platform bans), NodeAuth provides you with a multi-layered asset protection umbrella. Please choose the most appropriate recovery path based on your current "survival resources."

## 🚑 Disaster Recovery Decision Matrix

| Available Resources | Recommended Path | Core Principle | Success Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PDF (Recovery Kit) + Full DB File** | **Path A: Perfect Environment Revival** | Restore original `ENCRYPTION_KEY` and mount the old DB | 100% |
| **Exported Backup File (.json / .csv)** | **Path B: Business-Level Data Import** | Perform "Data Import" in a new instance and verify password | 100% |
| **Encrypted Backup + Offline Script** | **Path C: Extreme Manual Offline Read** | Use Node.js script to view plaintext JSON directly | 100% |

## 📄 Path A: Environment Revival (Using Recovery Kit)
**Scenario**: You have the original database (e.g., Cloudflare D1 or Docker `data/` directory), but you cannot remember the original `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable.

1.  **Prepare Environment**: Redeploy a new NodeAuth instance on any platform.
2.  **Retrieve Key**: Open your **Recovery Kit PDF** and find the saved `ENCRYPTION_KEY`.
3.  **Rebuild Variables**: Manually enter this Key into the environment variables of the new deployment environment.
4.  **Connect Data**: Ensure the new deployment is connected to your previous database.
5.  **Instant Revival**: Log into the new instance. Since the keys match, the system can immediately decrypt and read the original accounts in the database.

> [!TIP]
> **Generation & Verification**: To ensure you properly save this "lifeline," the system requires you to manually enter the **last 4 characters** of the key after downloading the PDF during initialization. Only after successful verification is the instance officially activated.

## 📂 Path B: Business-Level Recovery (Using Data Import)
**Scenario**: You do not have the old database, but you have a habit of regular "Data Exports" or have enabled "Scheduled Cloud Backups."

1.  **Prepare Environment**: Setup a completely new NodeAuth instance with new environment variables.
2.  **Get Files**: Download the latest backup package from your USB drive, email, or Telegram/S3/Cloud Drive.
3.  **Perform Import**:
    *   Go to "Data Management" -> "**Data Import**".
    *   Upload your `.json` or `.csv` file.
    *   For encrypted JSON, enter the **backup password** you set during backup (Note: this is usually different from the app PIN).
4.  **Merge Success**: Your 2FA assets will be imported in bulk into the new instance.

## 🛠️ Path C: Manual Offline Decryption (Using Script)
**Scenario**: Extreme survival environment, unable to set up the NodeAuth service immediately, but urgent need to view a specific account's Secret or dynamic code.

*   **Prerequisite**: Encrypted `.json` backup file + Backup password + [scripts/decrypt_backup.js](https://github.com/nodeauth/nodeauth-worker/blob/main/scripts/decrypt_backup.js).
*   **Requirements**: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
*   **Command**:
    ```bash
    node decrypt_backup.js <backup_file.json> <backup_password>
    ```
*   **Result**: Decrypted plaintext data will be displayed directly in the console and saved as a JSON file.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Ultimate Warning**: If you lose your Recovery Kit (resulting in the loss of your `ENCRYPTION_KEY`) and have never exported any backup files, **no one in the world (including the developers) can help you recover your data**. Please print your Recovery Kit and keep it safe with your important documents.
