# Ghost Mode

Ghost Mode is designed to protect your data privacy in physical social settings, preventing snooping or accidental screen leaks via screen previews.

## 👻 Core Features

### 1. Automatic Gaussian Blur
Once enabled, NodeAuth will monitor the browser's `visibilitychange` event in real-time:
*   **Background Instant Activation**: When you swipe up to switch apps on your phone or switch windows on your computer, a **15px Gaussian blur** will immediately cover the NodeAuth interface.
*   **Prevent Task Snapshots**: This effectively prevents the operating system from generating thumbnails containing your 2FA dynamic codes in the "Task Manager / App Switcher" preview.

### 2. Privacy Long-Press to View
By default, the verification codes in the list are masked as `••••`:
*   **Long-Press to Reveal**: You must long-press the item with your finger for more than 250ms for the real code to fade in.
*   **Anti-Accidental Contact**: The code is masked again as soon as you release your finger, greatly reducing the probability of code leakage in crowded subways or elevators.

### 3. Sensitive Operation Desensitization
When performing high-risk operations such as importing, exporting, or resetting the master key, the system automatically lowers the background transparency and removes obvious red dot reminders.

## 🛠️ How to Configure
1. Go to "System Settings" -> "**Ghost Mode Settings**".
2. Respectively enable "**Anti-snooping Mode (Background Blur)**" and "**Privacy List Display**".
