# Passkeys

Passkeys provide hardware-level authentication based on the FIDO2 standard. They allow you to unlock your NodeAuth account using biometrics (fingerprint, face recognition) or physical Security Keys.

## 🛠️ Registering a New Passkey
1. Go to "System Settings" -> "**Passkey Management**".
2. Click "**Add Device**".
3. Follow the system prompts to complete authentication (e.g., press your YubiKey or verify via Touch ID).
4. The system will physically bind this hardware credential to your account backend.

## 🔑 Technical Details: PRF Extension
NodeAuth supports the advanced **PRF (Pseudorandom Function)** extension:
*   **Derived Encryption**: When enabled, the local database decryption key is derived directly from within the security chip.
*   **Non-Persisted Features**: Since the key never touches JS memory, it greatly enhances protection against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

## 🗑️ Revocation & Management
*   **Inline Renaming**: To distinguish between your iPhone, Mac, or Windows devices, you can click the edit icon on the right side of the Passkey list to rename them.
*   **Physical Revocation**: If a device is lost, click "**Delete**" immediately. The physical credential for that device will be permanently invalidated.
*   **Audit Metadata**: You can view the creation time and the last time each Passkey was used.
