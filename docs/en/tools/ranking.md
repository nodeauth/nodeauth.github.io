When choosing a 2FA tool, security, openness, and data sovereignty are the three major criteria. Below is a horizontal comparison reference compiled by NodeAuth for your information.

## 🚩 Key Pitfall List
*   **Authy**: Despite its large user base, it **refuses to provide any export functionality**. Once you use it, your accounts are permanently locked into its ecosystem. NodeAuth strongly recommends migrating away from it.
*   **Microsoft Authenticator**: While it supports cloud synchronization, its backup mechanism may be unreliable if major platform accounts are compromised.

## 🏆 Recommended Open Source Ecosystem
| App Name | Open Source | Data Export | Offline | Evaluation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NodeAuth** | ✅ Fully Open | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Strong | Cross-platform, 0 cost, self-hosted data |
| **2FAS** | ✅ Open | ✅ Friendly | ✅ Offline | Excellent mobile interaction experience |
| **Aegis** | ✅ Open | ✅ Friendly | ✅ Offline | Strongest open-source choice on Android |
| **Ente Auth** | ✅ Open | ✅ Friendly | ✅ Offline | Good multi-device synchronization |

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics explained
1. **Open Source**: Is the code publicly auditable? Are there any backdoors?
2. **Export Freedom**: Does it allow users to take their own data in universal formats like JSON or CSV?
3. **Offline Capability**: Can the algorithm run independently without an internet connection?
4. **Backup Diversity**: Does it support users controlling their own backup files (e.g., saving to NAS or S3)?

> [!TIP]
> **Migration Advice**: If you are still using an app with "export lock-in", it is recommended to migrate to NodeAuth as soon as possible, either manually or via QR code scanning, while your old device is still available.
